                <p>It is a system that monitors the changes you make on a document (software project, office document, etc.) step by step, saves it whenever you want, and allows you to store and manage it on a computer on the internet or on a local device (respository / repo / repository).</p>

                    <p>You may have also heard the term Source Code Management System instead of Version Control System. Both mean the same thing.</p>
                
                    <p>What Does GIT Give Us?</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can store your files and version control information in multiple places (distributed). Thus, you can access your files independently of the device.</li>
                    
                    <li>With the SnapShot (snapshot) feature, you can record the current state of the project or files at any time by <strong>"commit"</strong>. This way, if you encounter a bug in the future, you can revert to any version at any time.</li>
                    
                    <li>After <strong>SnapShot</strong> is taken, you can see the modified files.</li>
                    
                    <li>It allows teams to work together on the same project. In this way, you can facilitate project development processes with the community.</li>

                    <li>You can specify files that you do not want to be versioned in the project. (like node_modules, .mp4, .log, .env)</li>

                <p>It is used to create an empty git repository in the directory of a project that is not yet under version control.</p>
                <code>$ git init</code>
                <p>GIT has many configurations and settings, two of which are user.name and user.email. We use the following commands to configure these settings.</p>
                <code>$ git config --global user.name "Name Surname"
                $ git config --global user.email "test@email.com"</code>
                <p>It is used to send newly added or modified files to the staged environment.</p>
                <code>$ git add <file or folder_name></code>
                <p>It is a command that allows to untrack a file added to the Staged environment, that is, to make it untracked.</p>
                <code>$ git rm  --cached <file or folder_name></code>
                <p>It gives information about the current status of the project being worked on. Information such as changes made, added and deleted files are listed.</p>
                <code>$ git status</code>
                <p>Commit is sending the files taken to the staged environment to the Local Repository. A best practice is to include a message describing the changes made during each save. In addition, each commit has a unique ID. In this way, you can revert to an old commit and you will not have any loss.</p>
                <code>$ git commit -m "first commit message"</code>
                <p>It allows us to view the commit history in the project. All commits are listed with their id, author, date and message.</p>
                <code>$ git log</code>
                <p>It is used to add, delete or list a new branch on local or remote repository.</p>
                <code>$ git branch <branch_name></code>
                <p>It is used when we want to switch between branches or commits.</p>
                <code>$ git checkout <branch_name></code>
                <p>It is used when we want to merge the changes in another branch with the current branch.</p>
                <code>$ git merge <branch_name></code>
                <p>It enables a copy of the files in an existing Remote Repository to be created on your computer.</p>
                <code>$ git clone <remote_URL></code>
                <p>It sends the commits we receive in our project to the remote repository.</p>
                <code>$ git push origin master</code>
                <p>It shows the differences between the files after the changes made on the repository.</p>
                <code>$ git diff HEAD</code>

            <article class="main-article">
                <p>The .gitignore file is a plain text file created in the root directory of our project. As the name suggests, it says ignore me. More precisely, if you have files that you want to ignore, that you do not want to be tracked in your local workspace, that are not needed for your teammates, or if the size of these files is so large that you do not need to put them in your repo, it says, "Use me."</p>
                <p>So what are these types of files?:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dependencies downloaded from package manager,</li>
                    <li>your image and video files (file sizes may be too large)</li>
                    <li>IDE plugins (eg .vscode)</li>
                    <li>Your files (configurations for your database) that should only be in your own workspace and not visible to others</li>
                    <li>Files containing API keys, credentials, or sensitive information (.env)</li>
                    <li>Temporary files in your working directory</li>
                    <li>Log files</li>
                    <li>Useless system files (for example the .DS_Store file of the MacOS operating system)</li>
                    <li>Files created like dist</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Or you can have any file.</p>
